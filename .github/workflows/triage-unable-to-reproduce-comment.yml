          Here are some tips for writing reproduction steps:
          - Step by step instructions accompanied by screenshots or screencasts are the best.
          - Be as specific as possible; include as much detail as you can.
          - If not already provided, include:
              - the version of the application you are using.
              - the operating system you are using
              - any environment factors you can think of.
              - any custom configuration you are using.
              - a log file from the day you experienced the issue (access log files via the file menu and select $LOG_PATH).
          - If relevant and can be shared, provide the repository or code you are using."
